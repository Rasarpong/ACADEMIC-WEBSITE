I am a PhD student in Applied Economics at the department of Applied Economics at Oregon State University. I am interested in solving economic problems by combining economic theory and tools with data science techniques.
My research interests include **Resource and Environmental Economics, Development Economics and Health Economics** 

I am a data science enthusiast. I use analytics, predictive modeling, and statistical machine-learning (ML) to derive patterns and insights that can inform economic decisions. I am able to collect, manipulate, and examine data to identify, explain, and forecast potential problems and complex relationships by analyzing and building statistical models from data.
