Abstract: The Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) is among the major nutrition education programs funded by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) with the aim of reducing food insecurity among low-income families. Theprogram reaches about 70,000 adults and youth of low-income families in the US, District of Columbia, and six U.S. territories. Prior studies have used self-reported data, which possesses measurement errors, to estimate the benefits of the program. This can lead to underestimation or overestimation of results. To address this limitation, I use clinically measured objective biomarkers, such as body mass index (BMI), blood sugar level (HbA1C) and blood pressure to estimate the benefits of EFNEP and compare it to the program costs. Results show that EFNEP benefits outweigh program costs. However, the use of self-report data underestimates the benefits of the program.
